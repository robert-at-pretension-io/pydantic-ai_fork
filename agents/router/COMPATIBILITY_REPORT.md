# Router Agent Compatibility Report

## Overview

This report evaluates the compatibility of `router_agent2.py` with the current pydantic-ai SDK. The analysis was conducted on May 20, 2025 using pydantic-ai version 0.2.5.

## Findings

### `router_agent.py` (Current Implementation)

The current `router_agent.py` is compatible with the pydantic-ai SDK and implements a router agent system that:

1. Defines specialized agents for search, calculation, and text analysis
2. Uses a main router agent to delegate to these specialized agents
3. Provides tools for information search, calculations, and text analysis
4. Implements a process query function to handle user queries
5. Includes CLI functionality for interactive use

### `router_agent2.py` (New Implementation)

The new `router_agent2.py` implementation introduces an iterative, planning-driven approach using Google Gemini models. However, it currently has compatibility issues with the latest pydantic-ai SDK:

1. **Import Errors**: It imports classes that don't exist in the current API:
   - `SystemMessage`
   - `UserMessage`
   - `AssistantMessage`

   These appear to be alternative message types that aren't part of the current pydantic-ai API. Instead, the current SDK uses:
   - `ModelMessage` (base class)
   - `ModelRequest` and `ModelResponse` (for requests and responses)
   - Various part types like `SystemPromptPart`, `UserPromptPart`, `ToolCallPart`, etc.

2. **Google Gemini Integration**: While the basic Google Gemini integration is available through:
   - `pydantic_ai.models.gemini.GeminiModel`
   - `pydantic_ai.providers.google_gla.GoogleGLAProvider`
   
   The specific implementation in `router_agent2.py` may need adjustments to match the current API.

3. **Loop-based Architecture**: The new implementation uses a more sophisticated loop-based architecture with planner/orchestrator agents that iteratively refine the solution. This approach is sound but requires updates to align with the current pydantic-ai API.

## Recommendations

1. **Update Message Types**: Replace the non-existent message types with appropriate alternatives:
   ```python
   # Instead of:
   from pydantic_ai.messages import ModelMessage, SystemMessage, UserMessage, AssistantMessage
   
   # Use:
   from pydantic_ai.messages import ModelMessage, ModelRequest, ModelResponse
   ```

2. **Message Handling Updates**: Update the message handling logic to use the current API's approach:
   ```python
   # Create user messages using ModelRequest with UserPromptPart
   # Create system messages using ModelRequest with SystemPromptPart
   # Process assistant responses using ModelResponse
   ```

3. **Test Incrementally**: After making these changes, test the implementation incrementally, starting with basic functionality like model initialization and simple requests before testing the full iterative planning system.

4. **Incorporate Graph-Based Approach**: Consider utilizing the graph-based approach from `graph_router.py` which seems to be more aligned with pydantic-ai's current architecture.

## Conclusion

The `router_agent2.py` implementation introduces valuable new features but requires significant updates to work with the current pydantic-ai SDK. The core architecture concepts are sound, but the implementation details need to be aligned with the current API patterns, particularly around message handling and model interactions.
