| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | **Central planning loop (single “Decider” + explicit `RouterState`)** | Turns the router from a dumb dispatcher into a *reasoning engine*: lets you chain agents, stop when goal met, parallelise independent work, and reuse the same logic for every new domain. Everything else (interrupts, metrics, new agents) plugs into this state machine. |
| **2** | **Shared session-context + semantic compression**                     | Eliminates the current re-fetch/re-compute tax, keeps token bills predictable, and gives every downstream agent richer input. Without it, the planner quickly blows past context limits.                                                                                    |
| **3** | **Graceful user-interrupt handling**                                  | Makes the system feel interactive and saves wasted tokens/work when the user changes direction. Cheap to add once you have the planner loop; high UX win.                                                                                                                   |
| 4     | Parallel execution of independent subtasks                            | Simple concurrency wrapper once the planner exists; cuts wall-clock latency for most real-world composite questions.                                                                                                                                                        |
| 5     | Verification agent                                                    | Directly improves answer correctness and trust; implement as a post-hook the planner can call when `confidence < x`.                                                                                                                                                        |
| 6     | Knowledge-base agent (lightweight)                                    | Start by stashing key/value facts in the shared context; full retrieval-augmented memory can come later.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 7     | Summarisation agent                                                   | Mostly a utility function the planner can call; value scales with context size.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 8     | Reasoning / Decision agents                                           | Useful but overlap with the planner’s own LLM calls—do later unless you need domain-specific logic.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 9     | Formal loop-control heuristics (stall detection, budget caps)         | Important, but you’ll get 80 % of the protection by hard-capping iterations and issuing a warning.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 10    | Fancy visualiser & debugging UI                                       | Nice for demos; adds little direct end-user value compared with the capabilities above.                                                                                                                                                                                     |

**TL;DR:**
Ship the **planner loop + shared context** first—they’re the backbone that lets every other fancy agent or UX feature plug in cleanly.






## Task Delegation Loop

The current router agent implementation provides a foundation for routing queries to specialized agents. Our future development will focus on transforming this router into a full-fledged orchestrator that can break down complex tasks and iteratively work toward solutions through a delegation loop.

## Core Architecture Vision

Instead of just routing a query once, the enhanced router will:

1. **Analyze** the user's task
2. **Decompose** it into subtasks
3. **Plan** the execution order
4. **Delegate** each subtask to appropriate specialized agents
5. **Evaluate** intermediate results
6. **Iterate** until the complete task is solved

This approach will enable handling complex multi-step tasks while maintaining a coherent context across multiple agent interactions.

## Specialized Agents to Implement

The following specialized agents would form the ecosystem of our router's delegation network:

| Agent Type | Primary Function | Examples |
|------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Planning Agent** | Break down complex tasks into specific subtasks | "Create a 3-step plan to analyze this dataset" |
| **Research Agent** | Find and extract information from various sources | "What are the latest studies on renewable energy?" |
| **Reasoning Agent** | Analyze problems and create logical arguments | "Evaluate the pros and cons of this approach" |
| **Coding Agent** | Write and modify code for specific programming tasks | "Create a function to parse this JSON format" |
| **Data Analysis Agent** | Process and analyze numerical data | "Calculate the statistical significance of these results" |
| **Verification Agent** | Check correctness of solutions | "Is this SQL query optimized?" |
| **Summarization Agent** | Condense information from multiple sources | "Summarize the key findings from these reports" |
| **Decision Agent** | Make recommendations based on multiple inputs | "Which database technology should I use for this case?" |
| **Knowledge Base Agent** | Maintain context information throughout task-solving | "Remember and apply information from earlier steps" |
| **User Interaction Agent** | Ask clarifying questions when needed | "What specific format would you like the output in?" |

## Iterative Planner Approach

Our enhanced router architecture will adopt an iterative planner approach, treating the router as a dynamic orchestrator rather than a one-shot dispatcher:

### Key Components of the Iterative Planner

1. **Single "Decider" Step After Every Subgraph Call**
   - After any specialized agent finishes, its structured output (plus the evolving shared context) is fed back through the router's "planning" function
   - This planning step decides whether:
     - The overall goal is met → exit with final answer
     - Another domain agent should run next → enqueue it
     - The router needs to ask the user a clarifying question → surface it
   - This keeps all branching logic in one place and avoids hard-wiring agent sequences

2. **Explicit State Object**
   - The state maintains:
     - **Goal**: The user's original request
     - **Context**: Facts and intermediate results shared across turns
     - **Plan**: List of remaining subtasks (which can grow or shrink dynamically)
     - **History**: Messages exchanged so far
   - Each loop iteration updates this state, making every agent invocation reproducible and debuggable

3. **Loop Control & Safety Rails**
   - **Max iterations / token budget**: Stop if the plan cycles or cost grows beyond thresholds
   - **Dependence check**: Only enqueue an agent if its input requirements are satisfied
   - **Progress heuristic**: If two consecutive iterations leave the plan unchanged, assume you're stuck and exit gracefully

4. **Uniform Contract for Agent Outputs**
   - Every specialized agent returns `{status, data, suggestions}`
   - `Suggestions` is an ordered list of next actions the agent thinks would be useful
   - The router isn't obligated to follow them, but can merge these hints into its planning step

5. **Planning Implementation Options**
   - **LLM-prompted**: Pass the current state (compressed) to a "planning" LLM that emits the next action
   - **Rule-based first, LLM fallback**: Simple routing for common cases, LLM for high ambiguity
   - **Graph node**: In our Pydantic-Graph, a planning node decides the next node and loops back until reaching End

6. **Parallel vs. Serial Refinement**
   - For independent subtasks, enqueue multiple agents in parallel
   - For dependent chains (e.g., search → calculation), keep them serial so each result feeds the next

7. **Stop-criteria & Final Synthesis**
   - The planner declares completion when plan is empty and context contains an answer
   - A dedicated "synthesis" agent creates the final user-visible answer

8. **Graceful User Interrupts**
   - Users might need to refine or redirect the task mid-loop
   - While executing agents, the system listens for incoming user messages
   - If a user message is received, it raises a `UserInterrupt` signal
   - The planning node catches this interrupt and re-evaluates with the new input
   - The planner can then decide to:
     - Discard current work and start a new plan
     - Incorporate the new information into the existing plan
     - Ask for clarification about how to proceed
   - This creates a more responsive, conversational experience

            await asyncio.sleep(0.1)  # Check every 100ms
    
    interrupt_task = asyncio.create_task(monitor_user_messages())
    
    # Wait for either domain completion or user interrupt
    done, pending = await asyncio.wait(
        [domain_task, interrupt_task],
        return_when=asyncio.FIRST_COMPLETED
    )
    
    # Cancel the pending task
    for task in pending:
        task.cancel()
    
    # If domain completed normally, return its result
    if domain_task in done:
        return await domain_task
    
    # If interrupted, return a special indicator
    return None  # Domain execution was interrupted
```

## Task Delegation Loop Architecture

The enhanced router will maintain:

1. **Task State**: Current progress toward the goal, information gathered, decisions made
2. **Execution Plan**: Sequence of subtasks to be completed
3. **Success Criteria**: How to determine when the task is complete

### Loop Algorithm Pseudocode

```
1. Receive user task
2. Initialize task state and plan
3. LOOP:
   a. Check for user interrupts (process immediately if present)
   b. Check for exit conditions (max iterations, plan stalled, etc.)
   c. Execute planning step to evaluate current state
   d. If goal is met → finalize and return result
   e. If user clarification needed → request clarification and wait
   f. If further processing needed:
      i. Select appropriate specialized agent
      ii. Execute agent with context from current state (with interrupt monitoring)
      iii. If interrupted during execution → handle interrupt
      iv. Update state with results and suggestions
   g. Loop back to 3.a
```

## Implementation Approach

For the task delegation loop, we've chosen to build upon our existing **graph-based implementation** using Pydantic-Graph. This approach provides several advantages:

- **Explicit state representation**: The state machine clearly models the flow of processing
- **Visualizable architecture**: The graph structure can be visualized using Mermaid diagrams
- **Extensible nodes**: New specialized agents can be added as nodes in the graph
- **Clear transitions**: The flow between different processing stages is explicit
- **State inspection**: The state at any point in the flow can be inspected and debugged

Our current implementation already uses Pydantic-Graph to model the router as a state machine where:
- Each node represents a stage in the task-solving process (classification, search, calculation, etc.)
- Edges represent transitions based on intermediate results
- Node handlers correspond to specialized agent calls

This foundation leverages the existing graph capabilities of the Pydantic ecosystem and provides a clear path for enhancing the router with more complex task delegation capabilities.

### Supporting Approaches

While our primary implementation uses Pydantic-Graph, we'll complement it with these approaches:

#### Tool-Driven Integration

Within our graph nodes, specialized agents will be accessed through a tool-driven interface:

```python
@dataclass
class PlanningNode(BaseNode[RouterState]):
    """Planning node that breaks down complex tasks."""
    
    async def run(self, ctx: GraphRunContext[RouterState]) -> NextNode:
        # Execute the planning agent
        result = await planning_agent.run(ctx.state.query, message_history=ctx.state.history)
        ctx.state.plan = result.output
        return NextNode()
```

#### Meta-Prompting

For specialized or dynamic cases, the router will generate prompts for specialized LLM agents, programming them on-the-fly for specific subtasks.

### Intermediary Context-Builder Layer

A critical enhancement will be adding a shared context that enables more effective communication between specialized agents:

| Goal | Why it matters | Key considerations |
| ---- | -------------- | ------------------ |
| **1. Introduce a shared session context** | Lets every specialist agent reuse facts, numbers, and intermediate results instead of recomputing. | • Define what kinds of data belong here (facts, parsed numbers, embeddings, partial calcs).  <br>• Keep the schema explicit—even if it's just a documented dict—so agents know what to expect. |
| **2. Use a dedicated "context-builder" agent as the first hop** | Centralizes extraction of entities, normalization of numbers, generation of search keys, etc. | • Feed it the raw user query *plus* any existing context.  <br>• Ask it to **augment**, not overwrite, the context.  <br>• Keep its output light and structured. |
| **3. Make every downstream tool receive that context** | Ensures search, calculation, and analysis agents start from a richer baseline. | • Pass the context object through your run-context / dependency mechanism.  <br>• Encourage tools to consult the context first (e.g., check for cached calculations). |
| **4. Persist conversation state safely** | You already track history; make it durable and process-safe. | • Use a small local store (SQLite / TinyDB / plain JSONL) instead of an in-memory dict.  <br>• Index by conversation/session ID.  <br>• Provide a purge/expiry policy to avoid unbounded growth. |
| **5. Separate orchestration from I/O** | Cleaner architecture and easier testing. | • Keep the core router pure: given *query + context + history* → returns *answer + new context + new messages*.  <br>• Wrap CLI/GUI/HTTP layers around that pure function. |
| **6. Guard against loop & bloat** | A context that grows unchecked can slow or derail the system. | • Set size limits (e.g., only keep N most recent facts).  <br>• Deduplicate equivalent entries.  <br>• Have the router decide when to stop delegating if progress stalls. |
| **7. Document the contract** | Future contributors—and future you—need clarity. | • Briefly state what each agent may read/write in the shared context.  <br>• Describe expected lifetimes (per request, per session, persistent). |
| **8. Implement semantic context compression** | Raw truncation loses meaning; preserve semantic content while reducing tokens | • Add an "auto-abstract" step that summarizes large text blobs into bullet points before entering shared context<br>• Apply progressive compression levels (light, medium, heavy) based on content size<br>• Use content-aware compression strategies for different data types (code, text, data)<br>• Maintain compression metadata for retrievability |

#### Context-Builder Implementation Pipeline

1. **Pipeline**

   1. Receive user input.
   2. Run *context-builder* → enrich shared context.
   3. Pass query + context into router.
   4. Router decides which specialist(s) to call, providing the enriched context each time.
   5. Router aggregates outputs, may update context further, returns answer.

2. **Persistence**

   * At the end of each turn, serialize both message history and the latest context.
   * Restore them on the next turn so the user can ask follow-ups seamlessly.

3. **Testing & iteration**

   * Start with a minimal context schema (e.g., `facts`, `numbers`).
   * Grow it only when a new use-case clearly benefits.
   * Monitor token usage; prune or compress context as needed.

#### Semantic Context Compression

To effectively manage token usage while preserving meaning, we'll implement intelligent semantic compression:

1. **Auto-Abstract Generation**
   - Summarize large text blocks into bullet points before storing in shared context
   - Apply semantic prioritization to retain the most important elements
   - LLM-powered summarization that preserves core meaning with fewer tokens

2. **Progressive Compression Levels**
   - Level 1: Lightweight compression (remove redundancies, standardize formatting)
   - Level 2: Medium compression (convert paragraphs to bullet points, extract key facts)
   - Level 3: Heavy compression (distill to core facts and relationships only)

3. **Content-Aware Compression**
   - Code: Preserve function signatures and critical logic, summarize implementation details
   - Text: Keep key points and conclusions, compress examples and explanations
   - Data: Maintain statistical significance, compress raw examples

4. **Retrievability**
   - Track what information was compressed and how
   - Maintain pointers to original content for retrieval if needed
   - Implement expansion capabilities when full details are required

```python
class ContextCompressor:
    """Intelligently compresses context while preserving semantic meaning."""
    
    def compress(self, content: Any, compression_level: int = 1) -> Tuple[Any, Dict[str, Any]]:
        """
        Compress content at the specified level while preserving key meaning.
        
        Args:
            content: The content to compress (text, dict, list, etc.)
            compression_level: Level of compression (1-3)
            
        Returns:
            Tuple of (compressed_content, metadata)
        """
        content_type = self._detect_content_type(content)
        compressor = self._get_compressor_for_type(content_type, compression_level)
        
        return compressor.compress(content)

# Integration with RouterState
@dataclass
class RouterState:
    # ... existing fields ...
    
    # Context compression
    context_compressor: ContextCompressor = field(default_factory=ContextCompressor)
    max_context_size_tokens: int = 2000
    context_compression_level: int = 1
    context_compression_metadata: Dict[str, Any] = field(default_factory=dict)
    
    def add_to_context(self, key: str, value: Any) -> None:
        """Add content to context with semantic compression if needed."""
        current_size = self._estimate_context_tokens()
        
        if current_size + self._estimate_tokens(value) > self.max_context_size_tokens:
            # Apply progressive compression based on size
            compression_level = min(3, self.context_compression_level + 1)
            
            # Compress the value
            compressed_value, metadata = self.context_compressor.compress(
                value, compression_level=compression_level
            )
            
            # Store the compressed value and metadata
            self.context[key] = compressed_value
            self.context_compression_metadata[key] = metadata
        else:
            # Store uncompressed
            self.context[key] = value
```

This approach ensures that context is intelligently managed without losing critical semantic meaning, which is far superior to raw truncation methods.

## Key Technical Challenges

1. **Loop Prevention**: Mechanisms to avoid infinite loops if a task can't be completed
2. **State Management**: Efficiently tracking progress across multiple iterations
3. **Knowledge Transfer**: Ensuring information gathered by one agent is available to others
4. **Balance**: Not getting stuck on one approach when another would work better
5. **Performance Optimization**: Minimizing token usage while maintaining context
6. **Domain Boundaries**: Defining clear boundaries between specialized agents while allowing flexible execution paths
7. **Interrupt Handling**: Gracefully handling user interrupts without losing important context or progress

| **1** | **Central planning loop (single “Decider” + explicit `RouterState`)** | Turns the router from a dumb dispatcher into a *reasoning engine*: lets you chain agents, stop when goal met, parallelise independent work, and reuse the same logic for every new domain. Everything else (interrupts, metrics, new agents) plugs into this state machine. |
| **2** | **Shared session-context + semantic compression**                     | Eliminates the current re-fetch/re-compute tax, keeps token bills predictable, and gives every downstream agent richer input. Without it, the planner quickly blows past context limits.                                                                                    |
| **3** | **Graceful user-interrupt handling**                                  | Makes the system feel interactive and saves wasted tokens/work when the user changes direction.

| 4     | Parallel execution of independent subtasks                            | Simple concurrency wrapper once the planner exists; cuts wall-clock latency for most real-world composite questions.                                                                                                                                                        |

| 9     | Formal loop-control heuristics (stall detection, budget caps)         | Important, but you’ll get 80 % of the protection by hard-capping iterations and issuing a warning.                                                                                                                                                                          |

**TL;DR:**
Ship the **planner loop + shared context** first—they’re the backbone that lets every other fancy agent or UX feature plug in cleanly.
